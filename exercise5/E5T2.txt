# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
- checkov - https://www.checkov.io/
- tflint - https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint

### Example vulnerability
- Ensure IAM policies does not allow permissions management without constraints
- Ensure every security groups rule has a description
- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0:0 to port 22
- Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0:0 to port 80
- Ensure that ALB drops HTTP headers
- Ensure ALB protocol is HTTPS

## Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- Clair - https://github.com/quay/clair
- Anchore - https://anchore.com/opensource/

## Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- AWS Config
- AWS Trusted Advisor
- AWS Security Hub
